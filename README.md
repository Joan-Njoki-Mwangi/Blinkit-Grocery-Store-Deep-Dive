# Blinkit-Grocery-Store-Deep-Dive

I’m the kind of shopper who loves a good bargain especially when something’s marked down to half price. Like many others, I’ve jumped on the bandwagon of chasing special deals. But it got me thinking: how do retail stores really operate when it comes to offers and pricing? Is “half off” truly the best deal for the customer, or is there more going on behind the scenes? And what do retailers actually stand to gain by giving us such attractive prices?
I also started wondering how promotions and campaigns bring in new customers and more importantly, how stores manage to keep us hooked in the long run. On the flip side, what happens when businesses pour money into these efforts but operational hiccups end up sinking the investment?

 So, I decided to go on a little “fishing expedition” of my own, exploring how online retailers work. Using the Blinkit dataset, I dug into how they uncover new markets, let go of ones that aren’t working, and strike the tricky balance of keeping stock levels just right.
